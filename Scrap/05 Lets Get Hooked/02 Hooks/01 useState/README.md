# Theory
React COmponent -> Normal JS Function
React Element -> Normal JS Object
React Hook -> Normal JS FUnction with super power




# Folder Structure
src
    - components
    - utils -> utilities 

# React Hook
It is Normal JS Utility Function.
React good at DOM operations.
React Datalayer sync with UI layer.

* useState()
* useEffect()

##### useState
when change the Datalayer automatically UI layer also changed.
It automatically refresh our Component.
whenever a state variable update react re-renders the component.


### React
##### Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)
* Virtual DOM 
    - Virtual DOM is not a Actual DOM.
    - Virtual DOM is representation of Actual DOM.
    - Virtual DOM is normal JS Object
* React doesnot touch HTML.
* It checks difference between two virtual DOMs and quickly updates it in UI.
